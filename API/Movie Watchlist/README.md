# Movie Watchlist

## A fully functional Movie Watchlist site which utilizes an API to retrieve movies

- The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API for retrieving movie data.
- Additionally, local storage will be utilized to store the user's watchlist, allowing them to add and remove movies as desired.
- The website provides a search bar where users can enter the name of a movie they want to find. JavaScript will handle the search functionality by making API requests to retrieve relevant movie data based on the user's input.
- Users have the ability to add movies to their watchlist by clicking on a "Add to Watchlist" button or icon associated with each movie.
- The selected movies will be stored in the browser's local storage, allowing users to access their watchlist even if they navigate away from the website or close the browser.
